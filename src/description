1) Create a new Angular 6 project with Angular CLI

The main module will have 2 components: Users and Posts

2) Create a Users Component that will list all available users from the API
(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) when it loads
Render the results in a visually pleasing manner.

You may use any third party UI library (Bootstrap, Material, Fontawesome), but the code should be original.
 Feel free to be creative.

2.1) Each result item should have a link to render the full User details based on their ID.
The full User details are available from the API (ex: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 )
When clicked, the link should fetch and render the User details in a visually pleasing manner.

3) Create a Posts Component and repeat the steps for User.
3.1) Create a button on the Posts page "Create Post" which when clicked,
 will render a form with the following fields:
-Title
-Body
The form will have a submit button, which when clicked will validate the form and perform a POST
to the API to save the new record.

When validating, both fields are required. Title has a max length of 24 and should be alphanumeric only,
and Body has a max length of 50.

Render an error message if validation fails.
An example of how to perform a POST to the API
is listed here: https://github.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder#how-to
Note: The API will only simulate the insert.

Render a success or error message after the simulated save completes.
4) Create a navigational menu so that you can navigate between User and Posts components.
You may use a third party library, but code must be original and visually pleasing.
